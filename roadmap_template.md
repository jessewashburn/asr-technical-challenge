 Specification-Driven Execution Roadmap

## 0. Purpose and Scope

**Objective:**  
Describe the desired system behavior clearly enough that one or more AI agents can implement it correctly, with built-in verification and minimal ambiguity.

**In Scope:**  
- Features, behaviors, and constraints explicitly listed below

**Out of Scope / Non-Goals:**  
- Anything not explicitly described in this document
- Speculative optimizations
- Refactors unrelated to the defined behavior

This document is the **single source of truth** for planning, execution, and verification.

---

## 1. Execution Environment (Lock First)

Before any planning or implementation begins, confirm:

- [ ] Correct repository and branch
- [ ] Required services running (DB, queues, APIs, etc.)
- [ ] Environment variables present and documented
- [ ] Tooling access verified (CI, test runners, AI tools)
- [ ] Target runtime identified (local, container, VM, CI)

**No implementation proceeds until this section is verified.**

---

## 2. System Context and Constraints

### Domain Context
Briefly explain *what problem this system or feature solves* in plain language.

### Architectural Constraints
- Languages / frameworks
- Runtime assumptions
- Security or compliance requirements
- Performance or scaling expectations

### Existing Decisions to Respect
- Prior architectural choices
- Naming conventions
- Data models that must remain stable

---

## 3. Desired Behavior (What “Correct” Means)

### Primary User / System Flows (Happy Paths)
Describe the main flows step by step at a behavioral level.

Example:
- User submits X
- System validates Y
- System persists Z
- System returns A

### Important Edge Cases (High-Level)
List edge cases without over-specifying implementation.

Example:
- Invalid input
- Partial failure
- Retry scenarios
- Idempotency concerns

---

## 4. Phased Roadmap Overview

Execution is broken into **strict, sequential phases**.  
Only one phase may be active at a time.

Each phase must:
- Produce a concrete artifact
- Have explicit acceptance criteria
- Be independently verifiable

---

## 5. Phase 1: Foundation / Scaffolding

### Goals
What this phase establishes (structure, wiring, contracts).

### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code compiles / runs
- [ ] Baseline tests pass
- [ ] No placeholder logic remains
- [ ] Logs show expected startup behavior

### Verification Steps
- How to manually verify
- Tests that must pass
- Outputs or artifacts to inspect

### Completion Gate
**Phase 1 is complete only when all acceptance criteria are met.**

---

## 6. Phase 2: Core Behavior Implementation

### Goals
Implement the primary business logic or system behavior.

### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Primary flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Error handling behaves as specified
- [ ] State transitions are correct and observable

### Verification Steps
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual walkthrough of happy path

### Completion Gate
No new features added beyond scope of this phase.

---

## 7. Phase 3: Edge Cases and Failure Handling

### Goals
Harden the system against expected failures and misuse.

### Tasks
- [ ] Edge case handling
- [ ] Retry / rollback logic
- [ ] Idempotency guarantees

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System fails safely
- [ ] No data corruption
- [ ] Errors are logged and traceable

### Verification Steps
- Simulated failures
- Negative test cases
- Log inspection

---

## 8. Phase 4: Verification and Testing

### Goals
Prove correctness, not just functionality.

### Test Coverage Expectations
- [ ] Unit tests for pure logic
- [ ] Integration tests for system boundaries
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical flows

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No skipped or flaky tests
- [ ] CI pipeline is green

### Verification Artifacts
List test reports, logs, screenshots, or recordings.

---

## 9. Phase 5: Cleanup, Documentation, and Handoff

### Goals
Make the work understandable and maintainable.

### Tasks
- [ ] Remove debug code
- [ ] Add inline comments where intent is non-obvious
- [ ] Update README or docs
- [ ] Capture known limitations

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Codebase is readable
- [ ] Docs match actual behavior
- [ ] No TODOs related to core functionality

---

## 10. Issues and Iteration Log

All discovered issues must be recorded here **in writing**.

### Issue Template
- **Description:**
- **Observed Behavior:**
- **Expected Behavior:**
- **Resolution:**
- **Verification Performed:**

---

## 11. Final Sign-Off Checklist

- [ ] All phases completed in order
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met for every phase
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Manual verification performed
- [ ] Spec updated to reflect final behavior

**Only after this checklist is complete is the work considered done.**
